## Before the Starting

You can find extra explanations and user guide in readme files in NewAllWorkFlows folder for new interface and AllWorkFlows folder for old interface.

[`AllWorkFlows`](https://github.com/ctolon/PythonInterfaceDemo/tree/main/AllWorkFlows) includes old interface parameters based on orignal repository [`O2DQWorkflows`](https://github.com/iarsene/O2DQworkflows)). Scripts and JSON configs found here are old, created only to test main scripts in O2DQWorkflows 

New interface developed and it includes Latest Config JSON files and configurable parameters. So if your local O2_Version > nightly-2022_08_23 you can go witn interface in [`NewAllWorkflows`](https://github.com/ctolon/PythonInterfaceDemo/tree/main/NewAllWorkFlows). Although all the installation steps are the same as the interface compatible with O2DQWorkflows, only the configuration parameters are different in the interface. You can list new commands and their usage with -h or --help command. For all other steps you can follow this readme.

P.S. The new interface is more stable and it is highly recommended to use it.
